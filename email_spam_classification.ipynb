    "For this problem, we will be analyzing emails taken from the [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). Data is provided in the `enron` data directory, with one file per email. The data set includes a combination of \"spam\" and \"ham\" emails. Spam emails are unsolicited messages intended to sell a product or scam users into providing personal information, while ham emails represent everything that is not spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "The language used in spam emails tends to be considerably different from typical business emails. Most spam filters leverage this difference in word frequencies to detect spam as it arrives and filter it out of email inboxes. We will use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster the emails and attempt to identify groups of emails which are likely to be spam."

       " 'subject info you requested kcc thank you for your interest judgment coursesoffers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten in of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime the non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between and billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt for every judgment that is paid more judgments take its place we identified this massive market years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making to over per year part time associates are earning between and per year some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of to people in attractive business offices today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this million million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between million to over million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on million at translates to annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal our associates earn half of this amount or per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately million dollars of all of our associates work out of their home are women and are part time one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear the way we train you is non confrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesn t know who you are you are not a collection agency simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to to of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you don t call them unless you want to you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect to you and to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for or you then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically to of what other firms charge for example we charge for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course when you receive the assets you keep and send to the original judgment holder once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in

e mail is the sales tool of the future take advantage of this non commercialized method of advertising now the longer you wait the more savvy people will be taking your business using e mail get what is rightfully yours program yourself for success and dare to think big it sounds corny but it s true you ll never make it big if you don t have this belief system in place multi level marketing mlm has finally gained respectability it is being taught in the harvard business school and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between and of all goods and services will be sold through multi level methods this is a multi billion dollar industry and of the millionaires in the u s made their fortune in the last several years in mlm moreover statistics show people become millionaires everyday through multi level marketing you may have heard this story before but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work the audience started to hoot and boo him he looked out at the audience and dead panned his response that s why i m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there with network marketing you have two sources of income direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business residual income is the secret of the wealthy it means investing time and money once and getting paid again and again and again in network marketing it also means getting paid for the work of others the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers fortunately sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it my name is jonathan rourke two years ago the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down sized and my position was eliminated after unproductive job interviews i decided to open my own business over the past year i incurred many unforeseen financial problems i owed my family friends and creditors over the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn t seem to make ends meet i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially in mid december i received this program via e mail six month s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs i received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year it didn t tell me i d have to write a book to make it but like i was saying in december i received this program i didn t send for it or ask for it they just got my name off a mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure i was reading it correctly i couldn t believe my eyes here was a money making phenomenon i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out i would at least get my money back but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all so i checked it out with the u s post office hrs and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter i decided why not initially i sent out e mails it cost me about for my time on line the great thing about e mail is that i don t need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are filled via e mail the only expense is my time i am telling you like it is i hope it doesn t turn you off but i promised myself that i would not rip off anyone no matter how much money it cost me here is the basic version of what you need to do your first goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks of your first program going out if you don t send out more programs until you do your second goal is to receive at least orders for report within weeks if not send out more programs until you do once you have your orders relax you ve met your goal you will make but keep at it if you don t get right off keep at it it may take some time for your down line to build keep at it stay focused and do not let yourself get distracted in less than one week i was starting to receive orders for report i kept at it kept mailing out the program and by january had received orders for report my first step in making in days was done by january had received orders for report more than i needed so i sat back and relaxed by march of my e mailing of i received with more coming in every day i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car please take time to read the attached program it will change your life forever remember it won t work if you don t try it this program does work but you must follow it exactly especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place it won t work you ll lose out on a lot of money in order for this program to work very fast try to meet your goal of orders for report and orders for report and you will make or more in days if you don t reach the first two goals with in four weeks relax you will still make a ton of money it may take a few months or so longer but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused that s the key i am living proof that it works if you choose not to participate in this program i am sorry it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you if you choose to participate follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was or you want to start your own business consider this a sign i did sincerely jonathan rourke p s do you have any idea what bills look like piled up on a kitchen table it s awesome a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program and one that is legal could not have been created by an amateur let me tell you a little about myself i had a profitable business for years then in my business began falling off i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me but it wasn t working finally i figured it out it wasn t me it was the economy inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since i don t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before the middle class was vanishing those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor as the saying goes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to move up or get rich inflation will see to that you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of one of the people you send this to may send out and your name will be on everyone of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now think about it before you delete this program from your mailbox as i almost did take a little time to read it and really think about it get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money you will definitely get back what you invested any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in it works jody jacobs richmond va here s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar this method of raising capital really works every time i am sure that you could use up to or more in the next days before you say no way please read this program carefully this is not a chain letter but a perfectly legal money making opportunity basically this is what you do as with all multilevel businesses we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners and we offer a product for every dollar sent your orders come by mail and are filled by e mail so you are not involved in personal selling you do it privately in your own home store or office this is the greatest multi level mail order marketing anywhere this is what you must do order all reports shown on the list below you can t sell them if you don t have them for each report send cash the name number of the report you are ordering your e mail address and your name return address in case of a problem make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems when you place your order make sure you order each of the five reports you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them within a few days you will receive via e mail each of the five reports save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the s of people who will order them from you important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps a through g or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you ll also see how it doesn t work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work a look below for the listing of available reports b after you ve ordered the five reports take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their c move the name and address under report down to report d move the name and address under report down to report e move the name and address under report down to report f move the name and address under report down to report g insert your name and address in the report position please make sure you copy every name and address accurately copy and paste method works well take this entire letter including the modified list of names and save it to your computer make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter your cost to participate in this is practically nothing surely you can afford you obviously already have an internet connection and e mail is free to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e mails where to find thousands of free classified ads and much much more here are two primary methods of building your downline method sending bulk e mail let s say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we ll assume you and all those involved send out only programs each let s also assume that the mailing receives a response using a good list the response could be much better also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of but continuing with this example you send out only programs with a response that is only orders for report those people respond by sending out programs each for a total of out of those people respond and order report those mail out programs each for a total of the response to that is orders for report those send out programs each for a total the response to that is i orders for report that amounts to each of bills for you in cash money then think about level five that s alone your total income in this example is for a total of remember friend this is assuming out of the people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out programs instead of believe me many people will do just that and more report will show you the best methods for bulk e mailing and e mail software method placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise let s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works assume your goal is to get only people to participate on your first level placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only downline members follow this example to achieve the staggering results below lst level your members with nd level members from those x rd level members from those x th level members from those x k th level members from those x k this totals remember friends this assumes that the people who participate only recruit people each think for a moment what would happen if they got people to participate most people get s of participants think about it for every you receive all you must do is e mail them the report they ordered that s it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the e mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can t advertise until they receive the report available reports order each report by number and name always send cash u s currency for each report checks not accepted always send your order via first class mail make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper so that the bill can t be seen against light on one of those sheets of paper include a the number name of the report you are ordering b your e mail address and c your name postal address in case your e mail provider encounters problems place your order for these reports now report the insiders guide to advertizing

the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new p l notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller i ll be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why don t you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if you d like me to send an e mail to whoever you re having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether they re short or long and how the market moved in comparison but it s the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether they re adjusting it based on the market

ted david and i i have a few other suggestions on format reporting changes as well the na power var of mm was not over its var limit of that would have been to require a report to skilling but if we had had to report it don t use wscc try to spell out or just don t use uk gas s var limit is not it s mm i can t tie in uk gas qtd and ytd p l shouldn t it be what s on the dpr adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that yeo person and get the info from them please the nd item for na gas shouldn t be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the var increase was mean to go at the bottom under rac comments the finance committe chairman notification for agg var is not it s notification requirement box ees had a var violation vs that is a skilling level violation let s have the re say limit violations and notifications for december let s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level veronica will

       " 'subject re tds project you might hear of this so i thought i better forward to you forwarded by mary solmonson hou ect on pm mary solmonson pm to scott mills hou ect ect cc joel henenberg na enron enron stephen stock hou ect ect subject re tds project i guess i have several comments to make to this string of mails so why not add one more mail first off thomas is following up on my suggestion to check into tds as when we met a few weeks ago on other issues i heard about tds by name for the first time although i admit i was aware of work being done to replace the applix functionality you had remarked that you liked the tds functionality and wondered whether that was the way to go rather than continue to evolve enron grid it is unfortunate that bill is not more cooperative with thomas request more in the continuing saga of poor communication and information sharing between our two teams clearly there needs to be much more communication and sharing of information as global rate services for many months bowed to the sitara team s priorities for enron grid which you now say probably won t be used there are many priorities in the wings to benefit the processes of global rate services that without has caused us to continue to experience a high rate of errors causing large impact to the p however enrongrid is the responsibility of a different group logically this needs to come together under the same group does the tds tibco infrastructure make sense current enrongrid rate server design assumes the curves are always updated to the rate sever database and then messaged from the database potential performance impact whereas tibco infrastructure does not require a database update first does the mkm curve publish subscribe supersede everything and provide a better global technical solution part of the london curve manager development team will be in houston next week therefore a briefing of the mkm curve manager is something that we are trying to get done functionally this will require a more vigorous gap analysis review before a decision can be made i am open to additional discussions on the technical direction but i do not think that alot of additional functional documentation needs to be done and timelines are not changing srm x thomas araujo enron am to yannis tzamouranis hou ect ect william e kasemervisz hou ect ect cc judy barnes hou ect ect scott mills hou ect ect vanessa schulte corp enron enron joel henenberg na enron enron subject re tds project bill i don t think anyone outside of sitara knows of tds if you could give myself and other interested parties a demo of tds i don t have a good understanding of the tds project if the project is similar to the enron grid as it is indicated in yannis s response the business users need to come together and decide the system of choice yannis makes good points of how to come to a decision i would change that the users provide the important features advantages and shortcomings of each product as they see it i would gather the users needs and timeline after deciding i would then like to get it involved to finalize a decision i would like to get the discussion started fairly soon due to the impeding business needs the first thing i would suggest is have a demo of both products to inform all impacted business users bill can we setup a demo for tomorrow or early next week thomas yannis tzamouranis ect am to william e kasemervisz hou ect ect cc thomas araujo corp enron enron scott mills hou ect ect subject re tds project bill i have had presentations of both of these projects that is not to say that i know them well since according to scott the choice is still open we have to make a concious decision as to which way we go in my mind this is a decision that has to be made by the user with my team s support i do not want and should not drive this decision the decision should be driven by the user based on usage business requirements what the phoenix group will provide is a server that does or soon will satisfy your business requirements the front end plug in is i think a decoupled issue in a server client environment on the other hand i think we should help you with the choice if you so want us i would actively consult with you to set up the choosing process which i imagine would go somewhat like this i would suggest that we do again and all deciding parties together get demos of each of these products business should put together a bullet point list of the functionality needed even a timeline and how the tool will be used so both allan and mike understand your needs clearly i also suggest that we ask tds and enron grid to provide us with a short document outlining the important features advantages and shortcomings of each product as they see it released features should be separated from future improvements the latter should be be accompanied by a time line limitations should be listed explicitly we take our impressions from the demos along with the writeups in a room and make the decision if needed business might have to spend the time to play with each of these products for a short period of time in my mind it is important to make choices like this one that will affect business for a long time based on enumerated and well understood facts such that usually get lost from a short demo please let me know what you think yannis william e kasemervisz pm to thomas araujo corp enron enron yannis tzamouranis hou ect ect cc subject re tds project i m not sure what you want to go over if you and yannis would like to have a demo of the tds grid applications let me know i ll try to set something up with scott also so we can discuss grid tds curve manager mkm thomas araujo enron am to william e kasemervisz hou ect ect cc subject tds project bill can you give me more information to the tds you are working on like the due dates the scope etc if you got some requirements documents or

ar would be kept in sync with unify ar by the unify sap interface we believe that the business logic for that decision has changed and are now recommending that unify ar be permanently turned off and all ar functions be performed in sap i have briefly summarized the change in business situation below two years ago today netting allowed by legal and credit only if netting contract was already in place netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible regardless of existence of signed agreement netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time canada nets across counterparties netting performed in physical only financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process ena considering netting physical and financial together all account coordinators were to apply their own cash cash applied centrally in power financial and canada individual coordinators apply cash only in physical gas cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements the company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team the account inquiry functionality in unify was thought to be a key on line tool old habits die hard most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data rather than using the on line functionality overapplication of cash was not to be allowed overpayments would be classified as on account with issues tracked in a case management system case management system does not exist allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account the counterparty legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterparty legal entity combination on the enron invoice given the number of legal entities enron has along with the number of entities our counterparties have this seems like a hopeless battle allowing cross application of cash seems easier corp required that intercompany settlements had to be settled with cash movement corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be settled with cash movement converting to sap ar simplifies the unify sap interface in the following ways bank deposits into sap do not have to be split off into unify cash entries in unify do not have to be interfaced back to sap unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to sap payables information does not have to be interfaced from sap to unify given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in unify controls built into unify are already obsolete unify does not maintain all products in one database making efforts to net across products in the future physical with financial for instance impossible our understanding of the netting process in sap indicates that there are no controls which sounds good at this point and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within sap however we emphasize that netting would be done in sap not at the time of finaling a payment in unify to repeat we are recommending that unify ar be turned off and we convert to sap ar we will schedule a meeting the week of february to discuss please call me at x with any questions or comments we will make this decision by february because the sap timeline does not allow any additional time

being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you

solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows between and this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering procurement supply of electrical equipments such as transformers and some rural electrification projects however these contracts were over invoiced by the committee thereby leaving the sum of us million dollars eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars in excess this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts leaving the balance of m dollars which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors we are handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service code of conduct does not allow us to operate off shore accounts hence your importance in the whole transaction is highly needed my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain of the total amount of us eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars while will be for us members of this panel and the remaining will be

conditions as we have stated below as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts we have decided that this

mississippian aged lodgepole carbonate build ups in the williston basin of montana and north dakota as well as the hardeman basin in west texas a new exploration technique is being applied to this play which has proven succesfull the lodgepole limestone was deposited in a very shallow ancestral williston basin the carbonate formation was developed as thousands of small circular limestone build ups or reefs the average distribution of the build ups is about reefs per square mile section the lodgepole reefs were deposited within a fairway a thousand miles long and thirty miles wide on the shelf of the williston basin the reservoirs in the williston basin may produce as much as barrels per day bopd at depths of to feet the most prolific reefs have each produced as much as barrels of light sweet oil the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand delek resource s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ofa ofa has applied a proprietary photo analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores this program produces well defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells oil for america s first partner conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells because each well may produce bod and bo cumulatively from a single well bore well in excess of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february from a wildcat well near dickinson north dakota conoco tested a heretofore non productive interval in the lodgepole limestone the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives a production test was reluctantly taken at feet the discovery well dickinson lodgepole unit initially produced at a rate of bopd the well has produced nearly million barrels of api gravity sweet crude oil and bcf of natural gas to date this discovery ignited a frantic race between and where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional d and d seismic programs the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of bopd the conoco dickinson lodgepole is the single most productive well having produced barrels of oil and nearly bcf of gas since september this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production during this time the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america this success however was not without failure the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult as a result by the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december in valley county montana miles northwest of dickinson north dakota in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at feet this reef initially produced at barrels per day but has now begun producing water it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef close to water the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs out of times and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin delek intends to

with a square foot state of the art manufacturing facility throughout and the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions development of a state of the art manufacturing facility and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth through the combination of its new facility million capacity the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california s bond approvals gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast gdvi should benefit greatly from the billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month march this presents in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout and including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into million per annum

of a variety of portable classroom designs including both single story and two story floor plans global modular s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre approved building plans commonly referred to as p c s or pre checked plans that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects dsa global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years depending on the term of the piggyback contract the strategic focus on california schools since california legislation has required that at least of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures there are five compelling reasons for this trend modular classrooms are faster to construct as quickly as weeks they cost significantly less as low as vs they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth the state department of education estimates that california will need more than classrooms each year for the next four years which equates to more than classrooms due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector public and private schools are expected to turn to portable modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years the california schools budget crisis on november a billion school facilities improvements bond proposal proposition was passed by california voters this bond measure passage does not include an approximate billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state a second bond measure worth billion went before the voters on the march these bond measures are about three times higher than the record billion bond california voters approved in the revenue generated from these bond measures

the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you i know you would be wondering why i am writing you with a request such as this but i only urge you to read on in november a british oil consultant contractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at some millions of united states dollars in my branch upon maturity i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address in america and britain but got no reply after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the chinese solid minerals corporation contractor died alongside his wife from an airplane crash the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate if you are familiar with private banking affairs those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes in his bio data form he listed no next of kin in the field of private banking opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said rarely do they nominate next of kin private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care in this case the british oil consultant contractor died interstate in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem this money has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year no one will ever come forward to claim it according to the laws of republic of china at the expiration of six years the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the funds what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational the world of banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose there is a large sum of money deposited in my bank i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased which i shall provide you with is presented i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my bank is concerned the bank s management has no single idea of what s the history or nature of the deposit they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward this is the situation this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man s family they have investigated for months and have found no family the investigation has come to an end consequently my proposal is thati will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased so that the fruits of this old man s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials acting in this capacity really is simple all you have to do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary authentication approval and a letter of probate administration in your favour for the transfer to be done a bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with will then facilitate the transferof this money to you as the beneficiary next of kin the money will be paid into your account for us to share i am aware of the consequences of this proposal i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail i ask that do not be vindictive and destructive if my offer is of no appeal to you delete this message and forget i ever contacted you do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector i am not a criminal and what i do i do not find against good conscience this may be hard for you to understand but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime i cannot let this chance pass me by for once i find myself in total control of my destiny this is my chance and i wont let it pass me by i ask that you do not destroy my chance if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family with new opportunities there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank there is no risk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction if you are interested in this lucrative role i urge you to indicate to that effect upon your response if favourable i shall provide you with more details and relevant information that will help you get full understanding of the transaction if you find yourself able to work with me contact me through this email address if you give me positive signals i will initiate this process towards a conclusion i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels i will deny knowing you and about this project i repeat i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account contact me only through the numbers i will provide for you and also through the email address i have provided my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy please observe this instruction religiously please again note i am a family man i have a wife and children i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences may be but i know

complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week and it will include trading results for the lst quarter reported in accordance with the risk management policy due to issues noted below this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can i talked to beth already and mrm met with chris abel s group to see if there was a short cut but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod we ll probably need to go with our best estimate of s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest as you recall the february th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure management reporting can be different of course chris abel s global energy operations group has prepared a rac dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy so that top management and the bod can see enron s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis a this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p l from a management reporting business unit perspective this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly as these limits are at an enron level the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p l and average daily var by commodity group the first rac dpr available is as of so while it has cumulative p l var is only as of note we re also comparing to lq but we re not going to attempt to resolve cross commodity reporting for that period except at a high level your participation is needed in resolving cross commodity reporting per the new rac dpr both retroactively for the lst quarter and going forward and rovar return on average daily var by commodity group for the lst quarter this aggregation of cross commodity activity has been completed by chris as of so he has what he believes to be p l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy what we don t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on obviously we re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner especially within a week so it appears we ll need to swag average daily var by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at by considering cross commodity activity you re aware of that took place throughout the quarter and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy and since we only have a few days i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues and then you and chris group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit when you consider materiality please involve your market risk contact while a transaction position book may not be material to gas or power it may be material to global products weather etc would you please help us with the following confirm your review of chris aggregation on the rac dpr at chris staff can walk you through are all the cross commodity positions you re aware of being reported correctly is there other cross commodity activity not present at and consequently not aggregated for the quarter s results but actually present during the first quarter and material if so estimate impact on p l and average daily var we re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel and if they point on specific material transactions we can address those you can determine best approach are there certain books in risktrac that have cross commodity positions imbedded combined either held currently or those that generated significant var or p l during the quarter going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial once you ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities average daily var for the quarter you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable swag approach after considering the information above please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross commodity activity and if not identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter please feel free to pursue those i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs or that you re not doing them i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with and that if they re not completely accurate given recent implementation that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement if any as you are the experts on your businesses results i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy on a separate note we need you to identify p l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr but do not really represent trading activity examples in the past are sfas transactions and other unique gain loss events we re reporting lq and lq so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity these adjustments should be minimal but we d like your input to conclude thank you for your cooperation regards cassandra schultz x cell home a for example north american electricity limits represent enron s consolidated na electricity trading activity without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p l and combined with gas var and p l etc heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products global products positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power with corresponding adjustment to global products results',\n",

       " 'subject re limit violations and notifications process shona rac and risk ops are in this together and of course we ll continue to help in understanding the violations i recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems the uk dpr issues the increased limit change and policy compliance activity etc my suggestions were meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier i was offering to be the bad guy and point out to the traders what we want them to do and meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits i think the confusion here is violation explanations being validated by the traders as you indicated below vs provided by the traders as we envision i confirmed with ted the traders are accountable for providing the explanation i m not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier we re suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations it should be the traders responsibility to get them to you and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading and should be able to easily explain why they re in violation or why they had a big loss whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail or they talk to their ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you whatever you think makes sense and works for you i m not trying to manage the process just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point at this point in this long series of e mails why don t we just talk face to face i can tell from your response you feel we re somehow not being team players but that is not my intent at all i ve tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much market risk values and appreciates your efforts and really i thought i was helping by using the policy s influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting perhaps a meeting with you and i and sally would be appropriate we can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with rac s expectations i agree we do have significant mid office needs and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since i joined rac and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by skilling we can continue to work on streamlining processes but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities i m willing to do whatever is needed and i don t think ted is hung up on who does what either it s just that right now we re staffed with the expectation that sally s group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems best regards cassandra forwarded by cassandra schultz na

hou ect ect subject re limit violations and notifications process dear cassandra thanks for the message i believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violations notifications to me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and i and vlady and i had discussed earlier today also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process thoughts to shona wilson na enron enron michael benien corp enron enron chris abel hou ect ect daniel falcone corp enron enron cc veronica valdez hou ect ect sally beck hou ect ect subject limit violations and notifications process shona to share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by skilling i know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below market risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements the new p l notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help it probably makes sense to re distribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations these should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group if the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller i ll be happy to send them an e mail explaining their compliance obligation under the policy why don t you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as i understand it is for global products for example and if you d like me to send an e mail to whoever you re having difficulty with i will just let me know who our market risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether they re short or long and how the market moved in comparison but it s the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether they re adjusting it based on the market moves etc let me know what else i can do to help streamline the process regards cassandra forwarded by cassandra schultz na enron on am from shona wilson am to cassandra schultz na enron enron cc

falcone corp enron enron cc veronica valdez hou ect ect subject limit violations and notifications comments i realize this has already gone out but i see a few errors that we should correct and actually i think we should call skilling and lay s and buy s assistants veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning e mail is ok for ted david and i i have a few other suggestions on format reporting changes as well the na power var of mm was not over its var limit of that would have been to require a report to skilling but if we had had to report it don t use wscc try to spell out or just don t use uk gas s var limit is not it s mm i can t tie in uk gas qtd and ytd p l shouldn t it be what s on the dpr adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that yeo person and get the info from them please the nd item for na gas shouldn t be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the var increase was mean to go at the bottom under rac comments the finance committe chairman notification for agg var is not it s notification requirement box ees had a var violation vs that is a skilling level violation let s have the re say limit violations and notifications for december let s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level veronica will

explosive detection device capable of finding its targets from tens or hundreds of meters there is no other eds device which is so powerful that can locate almost any explosive behind concrete walls from distance of tens of meters the competition there are many companies in the industry of sniffing explosives some of them are public and they are companies like ison hwpr or hiet and all of them have devices which can locate explosive from inches feet feet or close to that compared to these results sn fx device is tens of times better and smaller in size and yet cheaper snfx announced the release of sniffex version a handheld explosives detection device which the company claims can locate nitro based explosives from a distance of to feet depending on the quantity of the explosive and environmental conditions the company also stated that to the best of their knowledge sniffex is the first device of its kind that can operate from such distances and find exp losives behind barriers

engaged in to develop a business plan for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical business in aa was engaged to develop a blueprint of eim major processes deal execution deal capture risk management logistics settlements and financial reporting down to level processes the initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the blueprint a gap analysis of enron systems to business needs and recommended systems a complete roadmap should be laid out with a months months months and months timeline the plan addresses tactical also our overall objective build an infrastructure people processes and systems that is scalable and supports the trading business of eim the current industries are forest products and steel however additional industries may be added the targeted infrastructure would require little change to support new industries the delieverable is expected by the end of we d be happy to visit with you all video conference or houston to give you more information let me know how to proceed thanks again for your time since i wasn t able to attend the controllers conference last i m glad i got to meet you last week stay in touch brenda to brenda f herod hou ect ect cc mike jordan lon ect ect paul wallace lon ect ect subject metals brenda as discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality between enron metals and eim that should allow leverage off common goals in particular i promised info on a few areas project q assessment a lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to enron metals being to do with interfaces with our as ysstem however high level issues which formed part of the decision to not develop this for enron metals were q is over specified for metals traffic logistics for metals is less complex than oil coal metals process tends towards buy store sell whereas for liquids the storage is not as prevelant metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship barge inventory controls again the reports produced here have been very specific to enron metals paul wallace a manager in the co ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area i would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general funding of inventory we have a structured finance facility here in london the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar metals commercial or bill appleby global finance as an intro to the issues faced curve management process the markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location e g for copper this means we have a grid with brand groups and sets of port groups for europe for the us and for the far east the maintaince price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i e price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote re recruitment of paper traders i haven t been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum one of the metals traders in chicago is a trader of recylced paper i ll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in london i d appreciate same for eim regards andy',\n",
